    <p>What is a star?: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>A star is a celestial object mainly composed of hydrogen and helium. </li>
        <li>During nuclear fusion, a star generates heat and light. </li>
        <li>The birth of a star is from gravity contracting gas and dust together until the
            center is hot enough to generate energy.
        </li>
        <li>A star can also end once they burn out their hydrogen, becoming a red giant phase. After that,
            the star creates a nebula, then become a white dwarf, where they slowly fade away.
        </li>
